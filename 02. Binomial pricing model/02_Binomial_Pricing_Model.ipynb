    "# Binomial Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simple model with the ability to illustrate fundamental concepts in option pricing and risk management. It assumes that an asset can only move up or down by a known amount in each time step, the model makes it easy to understand how options can be hedged to eliminate risk. This leads to the idea of risk-neutral valuation, where the focus is on constructing a risk-free portfolio rather than predicting exact probabilities of future price movements. The model's discrete nature provides a clear framework for calculating option values and understanding the impact of volatility and other factors on pricing.\n",
