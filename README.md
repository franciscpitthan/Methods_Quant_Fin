# Methods_Quant_Fin
 
  Compilation of applied theory and methods used in quantitative finance, mostly with Python. By Francisco Pitthan.

  This is a repo for educational purposes, I plan to update it to cover materials about pricing, risk valuation, and forecasting. The topics are loosely inspired by Paul Wilmott's book *Quantitative Finance* and CQF's Program. It is suplemented by academic papers, topics covered in Yves Hilpisch's *Python for Finance* book, classes I followed at Coursera and DataCamp, and additional packages I've found useful.

  If you found any typos/errors, or if you have any comments/suggestions, feel free to reach me (franciscopitthan at gmail.com).
