# Methods_Quant_Fin
 
  Compilation of applied theory and methods used in quantitative finance, mostly with Python. By Francisco Pitthan.

  This is a repo for educational purposes, I plan to update it to cover materials about pricing, risk valuation, and forecasting. The topics are loosely inspired by Paul Wilmott's book *on Quantitative Finance* (together with his 'baby brother' *introduces Quantitative Finance*) and CQF's Program. It is suplemented by academic papers, topics covered in Yves Hilpisch's *Python for Finance* book, classes I followed at Coursera and DataCamp, and additional packages I've found useful.

  I also plan to include examples of applications using open sourced data. **UPDATE:** I am currently working on an appendix of pandas & numpy for data wrangling, this will be included shortly (TBD).  Future updates will also be based on exploratory data analysis and the integration with BI softwares. Moreover, through the use of Kaggle databases, I plan to cover other topics in risk modeling, management, and prediction. **UPDATE 2:** This project will be continued from september onwards.

  If you found any typos/errors, or if you have any comments/suggestions, feel free to reach me (franciscopitthan at gmail.com).
